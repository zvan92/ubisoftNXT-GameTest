# ubisoftNXT-GameTest
Playing with the API for the Ubisoft Toronto NXT Showcase (http://toronto.ubisoft.com/nxtshowcase/).
<hr>

Changes to the default API:

-> New "Box" and "Player" classes with initialization (x & y positions + length & width) & render methods

-> Player can be moved using W, S, A, D

-> Basic collision detection: player object turns blue after coming in contact with any box
